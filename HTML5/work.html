<strong>Information why you are writing the letter</strong> <p>Through the medium of your esteemed and respected daily, <br>
I wish to inform the municipal authorities of the difficulties the residents of my locality are facing due to the construction and repair work currently happening in our area<br>
.Monsoon season has started a few days ago and is compounding our problems.</p>
<p>The repair work has been ongoing for five weeks now and is falling way behind schedule. And now with the current weather conditions,<br>
 we are having persistent problems of water logging and flooding in our area.<br>
 Another worry is about the accidents that may occur due to the debris lying around the road. Diseases caused due to waterlogging are another one of our concerns.</p>
